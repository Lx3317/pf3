      Welcome to College of Science and Technology of The University of
      Cambodia. For everyone who wishes to pursue for any AA and BA degrees of
      the study programs, please register now or visit the campus of The
      University of Cambodia. Data science combines statistical tools, methods,
      and technology to generate meaning from data. Artificial Intelligence
      takes this one step further and uses the data to solve cognitive problems
      commonly associated with human intelligence, such as learning, pattern
      recognition, and human-like expression.
