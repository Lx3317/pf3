      Welcome to College of Science and Technology of The University of
      Cambodia. For everyone who wishes to pursue for any AA and BA degrees of
      the study programs, please register now or visit the campus of The
      University of Cambodia. Computer science focuses on the development and
      testing of software and software systems. It involves working with
      mathematical models, data analysis and security, algorithms, and
      computational theory. Computer scientists define the computational
      principles that are the basis of all software.
